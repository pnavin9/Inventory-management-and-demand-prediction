# Inventory Management and Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project, titled "Inventory Management and Demand Prediction," was presented at Convolve, IIT Guwahati. The objective was to develop a Time Series Forecasting model to predict product demand in upcoming quarters.

## Presentation and Colab Notebook
The presentation slides for this project provide an overview of the problem statement, approach, methodologies, and achieved results. Additionally, the project's code was developed and documented in a Colab Notebook, which enabled seamless collaboration and access to the data analysis and modeling procedures.

## Methodologies and Techniques
The project incorporated several methodologies and techniques to effectively predict product demand. These included:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed using Pandas and PowerBi, enabling the team to gain valuable insights and identify patterns in the dataset.
- Feature Engineering: The team engaged in feature engineering to create new metrics and variables that further improved the model's predictive capabilities.

## Forecasting Model
The core of the project involved building a robust Time Series Forecasting model to predict product demand for the upcoming quarters. To achieve this, the team employed various Machine Learning algorithms, including:
- ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average): Used to model the time series data and make predictions based on past observations.
- ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variables): Extended version of ARIMA, incorporating external factors for enhanced forecasting accuracy.
- GBMs (Gradient Boosting Machines): Ensemble learning technique that combined multiple weak learners to improve prediction performance.
